    <h1>About</h1>
		<div><p>Welcome to Night Vale is a podcast presented as a radio show for the fictional town of Night Vale. It was created by Joseph Fink		and Jeffrey Cranor, is voiced by Cecil Baldwin, and is published by Commonplace Books. The podcast airs twice a month, and consists	of "news, announcements and advertisements" from the desert town, located "somewhere in the Southwestern United States". In 												an interview with NPR, Joseph Fink commented on the creation of the series, stating that he "came up with this idea of a town in that desert where all conspiracy theories were real, and we would just go from there with that understood."
Every episode of the podcast includes a piece of music as its "weather report", each by a different independently-published artist. The theme and background instrumental music to the series was created by the musician and composer Disparition. In July 2013, Welcome to Night Vale became the most downloaded podcast on iTunes.</p></div>

    <h1>Reception</h1>
		<p>The show has been described as "the news from Lake Wobegon as seen through the eyes of Stephen King", and Christopher Wynn of The Dallas Morning News characterized it as "NPR meets The Mothman Prophecies." The Daily Dot's Gavia Baker-Whitelaw compared the podcast as being "caught somewhere between Weird Twitter and 'Tales of the Unexplained'" and that it is "well worth a listenâ€”although possibly not after dark, if you live in a small town yourself." Colin Griffith of The AV Club said the show is "really well done, offering a surrealist/absurdist (and occasionally existentialist) take on community radio, with dispatches from the small, delectably nightmarish desert town of Night Vale." Writing for TechGeek, Erin Hill considered the uniqueness of the podcast to be because of "its presentation of what is ordinary", adding that "many of the things that Cecil reports on goes against our idea of normal, but is presented in a manner that makes it seem mundane."</p>
        
<p>In July 2013, Welcome to Night Vale was ranked second on the top 10 audio podcasts list on iTunes, behind radio program This American Life. During the same month, it surpassed This American Life to become first on the podcasts list, having received 150,000 downloads during a single week.</p>

<p>Co-producer Jeffrey Cranor attributed this spike in popularity to both Tumblr and fans of the television series Hannibal. Max Sebela, a creative strategist for Tumblr, stated that the fan following began to "spiral out of control" beginning on July 5, with that week having "20,000-plus posts about 'Night Vale,' with 183,000-plus individual blogs participating in the conversation, and 680,000-plus notes." The Twitter account for the podcast has been noted as having more than 20,000 followers by July 2013. The show has a fan following on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, with fan fiction and fan art having a particular focus on the romantic relationship between the show's narrator character and the scientist Carlos.
